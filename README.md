## 🚀 Project Overview

**Solana Calculator** is a simple yet powerful smart contract developed on the Solana blockchain. The application leverages the **Anchor framework** to provide basic arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, which are executed on-chain. This project serves as a learning tool for understanding Solana's blockchain mechanics and the use of the Anchor framework to simplify program development.

### Key Features

- **🔢 Arithmetic Operations:** Perform basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction) on the Solana blockchain.
- **⚙️ Built with Rust:** The core logic is implemented in Rust, ensuring performance and reliability.
- **🔗 Solana Integration:** Fully integrated with the Solana blockchain, utilizing the Anchor framework for seamless development.
- **🧪 Testable:** Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the operations and program flow.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Rust:** For writing the smart contract logic.
- **Anchor Framework:** Simplifies Solana development by providing a set of developer tools.
- **TypeScript:** Used for the client-side interaction with the Solana program.
- **Solana Devnet:** The program is deployed and tested on Solana's Devnet.

   cd solana-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have **Node.js**, **Rust**, and **Solana CLI** installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build and Deploy the Program:**

   ```bash
   npm run build:program
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   Use the following commands to interact with the calculator program:

   ```bash
   npm run start add -- num1 num2  # Example: npm run start add -- 4 2
   npm run start subtract -- num1 num2  # Example: npm run start subtract -- 4 2
   ```
